Haste

Megamorph <span class="tip mana-icon mana-red" title="1 Red Mana">R</span> <em>(You may cast this face down as a 2/2 creature for <span class="tip mana-icon mana-colorless-03" title="3 Colorless Mana">3</span>. You may turn it face up any time for its megamorph cost and put a +1/+1 counter on it.)</em>

When Kolaghan Stormsinger is turned face up, target creature gains haste until end of turn.
