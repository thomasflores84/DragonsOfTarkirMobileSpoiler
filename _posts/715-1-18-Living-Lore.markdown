As Living Lore enters the battlefield, exile an instant or sorcery card from your graveyard.

Living Lore's power and toughness are each equal to the exiled card's converted mana cost.

When Living Lore deals combat damage, you may sacrifice it. If you do, you may cast the exiled card without paying its mana cost.
