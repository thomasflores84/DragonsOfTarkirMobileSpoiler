Creatures with power less than Den Protector's power can't block it.

Megamorph <span class="Colorless Mana">1</span><span class="Green Mana">G</span> <em>(You may cast this card face down as a 2/2 creature for <span class="Colorless Mana">3</span>. Turn it face up any time for its megamorph cost and put a +1/+1 counter on it.)</em>

When Den Protector is turned face up, return target card from your graveyard to your hand.
