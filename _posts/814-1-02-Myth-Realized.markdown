Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, put a lore counter on Myth Realized.

<span class="tip mana-icon mana-colorless-02" title="2 Colorless Mana">2</span><span class="tip mana-icon mana-white" title="1 White Mana">W</span>: Put a lore counter on Myth Realized.

<span class="tip mana-icon mana-white" title="1 White Mana">W</span>: Until end of turn, Myth Realized becomes a Monk Avatar creature in addition to its other types and gains "This creature's power and toughness are each equal to the number of lore counters on it."
