Ire Shaman can't be blocked except by two or more creatures.

Megamorph <span class="tip mana-icon mana-red" title="1 Red Mana">R</span> <em>(You may cast this card face down as a 2/2 creature for <span class="tip mana-icon mana-colorless-03" title="3 Colorless Mana">3</span>. Turn it face up at any time for its Megamorph cost and put a +1/+1 counter on it.)</em>

When Ire Shaman is turned face up, exile the top card of your library. You may play that card this turn.
