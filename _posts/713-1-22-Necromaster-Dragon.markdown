Flying

Whenever Necromaster Dragon deals combat damage to a player, you may pay <span class="tip mana-icon mana-colorless-02" title="2 Colorless Mana">2</span>. If you do, put a 2/2 black Zombie creature token onto the battlefield and each opponent puts the top two cards of his or her library into his or her graveyard.
