Each creature you control assigns combat damage equal to its toughness rather than its power.

<span class="tip mana-icon mana-green" title="1 Green Mana">G</span>: Target creature with defender can attack this turn as though it didn't have defender.

<span class="tip mana-icon mana-colorless-02" title="2 Colorless Mana">2</span><span class="tip mana-icon mana-green" title="1 Green Mana">G</span>: Creatures you control get +0/+1 until end of turn.
