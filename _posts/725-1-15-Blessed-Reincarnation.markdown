Exile target creature an opponent controls. That player reveals cards from the top of his or her library until a creature card is revealed. That player puts that card onto the battlefield, then shuffles the rest into his or her library.

Rebound <em>(If you cast this spell from your hand, exile it as it resolves. At the beginning of your next upkeep, you may cast it from exile without paying its mana cost.)</em>
