Trample

Kolaghan Forerunner's power is equal to the number of creatures you control.

Dash <span class="tip mana-icon mana-colorless-02" title="2 Colorless Mana">2</span><span class="tip mana-icon mana-red" title="1 Red Mana">R</span> <em>(You may cast this spell for its Dash cost. If you do, it gains haste, and is returned from the battlefield to its owner's hand at the beginning of the next end step.)</em>
